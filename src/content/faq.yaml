  - question: How can I run a business using Arrow's software?
    answer: |
      1. **Ship:** You can use the Arrow network like a traditional parcel delivery service, booking shipments through our application and dropping off packages at a nearby vertiport.  Your customers can pick up packages at the destination vertiport.
      2. **Operate:** Expand the Arrow network by owning cargo aircraft, vertiports, and hangars. The operators of these assets split the profits from every flight made with the Arrow network.
